## How to use this repo
All the code goes into either the hdrs or srcs folder. srcs contains all the actual
code and hdrs defines the interface, such as the function decelerations.
If you are confused on the implementation details of any function, please
look at the instructions folder. If you are still confused, please message
me on discord

PLEASE DO NOT MAKE ANY BRANCHES, AND STICK TO THE PART OF CODE YOU DECIDED
TO DO
