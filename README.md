## How to use this repo
All the code goes into either the hdrs or srcs folder. srcs contains all the actual
code and hdrs defines the interface, such as the function declerations.
If you are confused on the implentation details of any function, please
look at the instructions folder. If you are still confused, please message
me on discord
