This the how the function prototype needs to look like:
long anyBaseToBase10(const char* input_number, unsigned number_size,
    unsigned input_base);
Input:
- 
Output:
- long  //the value must be equivalent that of the input_number
        //the difference being the bases 


when is the function successful?

what is the output when the function char digit is valid?

what happens if the input char digit is NOT valid?
