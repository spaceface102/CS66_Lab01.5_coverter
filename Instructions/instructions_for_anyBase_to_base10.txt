the function prototype should be:

long anyBaseToBase10(const char* input_number, unsigned number_size,
 unsigned input_base);

upon success:
the input_number c string will be converted to a long
number, which will be equivalent to the value of the input_number
defined by their input_base. This number will ALWAYS be positive
no matter if input_number is negative. This means ignoring a
positive or especially a negative prefix when doing the calculation.

upon error:
the function will simply return -1. Since the function
is ALWAYS expected to return a POSITIVE number upon SUCCESS
this should be an obvious error return value.
