You will have to function protypes as the core of the whole assignment:

std::string baseConverter(const std::string& input_number, unsigned input_base,
unsigned output_base);

std::string baseConverter(const char* input_number, unsigned number_size,
unsigned input_base, unsigned output_base);

-NOTE, you really only need to make the function that takes a const char*
as the input number, as the function that takes a const std::string& can
itself call the other function as so:

return baseConverter(input_number.c_str(), input_number.size(), input_base, output_base);

baseConverter() must be able to handle negative numbers with the
indicator for a negative number being a single '-' prefix. The output
number must also have this '-' prefix. The function must also be able to
take a number with '+' as a prefix, The '+' prefix SHOULD NOT be added
to the output number, as the positive nature of the number is implied.
